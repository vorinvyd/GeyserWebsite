The author of the Fabric/Quilt support plugin in MCreator has decided to stop supporting it and leave the MCreator community (Read more HERE). This is quite sad news for the whole MCreator community and for me as well. Because of this, I have to stop supporting Fabric/Quilt in my mods until the analog or its sequel is released. This means that for 1.20.4 and 1.20.6 there will definitely be no support for my Fabric/Quilt mods. For 1.21 and above I can't say anything yet.

Goldorion thanks for this wonderful plugin! ❤️
